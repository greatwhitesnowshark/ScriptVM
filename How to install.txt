=====================================
 Emulate NPC Scripting - JavaScript
=====================================

1. Download IntelliJ IDE 

2. Open up the project in IntelliJ, go to the top and select Build -> Build Project

3. Open up the file `SmokeScript.java` in IntelliJ 

4. In the file view, right click the file name header for "SmokeScript.java", and in the drop down menu select:
	"Run SmokeScript.main()"

5. You'll see a pop-up dialog box appear with options for which script to execute.

6. To Add more scripts to this project, create a new .js script under the scripts/ directory. Then go to Config.java,
and add a new script to the array following the format - {"Selection string for the choice-box", "scriptname.js"}
(note: make sure that every line in the array has a comma ',' at the end of it, after the }, except for the last listing)

7. To Add new methods to this project, you can add methods to the following java files:
	- ScriptSysFunc.java
		- Methods added to this class will be usable in the script via the "self" variable
		- ex:  
			self.AskMenu(
				"What would you like to do?",
				["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"]
			);

	- User.java
		- Methods added to this class will be available in the script via the "pUser" variable
		- ex:
			pUser.SetNexonCash(pUser.GetNexonCash() - 1000);
			pUser.TransferField(910000000);

8. You can get crazier but this is the basic implementation of our sources NPC script engine, so you can build and practice
making basic NPC scripts ~

Any questions, see google and the repository owner in listed order ~
